# PyBer_Analysis

The Purpose of the Pyber Analysis was to analyze and compare the total rides, drivers, and fare for the 3 different types of cities "Rural, Suburban, and Urban". 

This ride sharing data shows that the Urban type cities have more Rides, Drivers, which bring them to having the lowest average per Ride Fare. Rural cities have the least Rides and Drivers and have the highest average Fare per driver.

I recommend riding sharing in Urban cities, because they have 3 times the amount of drivers then any other, so wait time is less and the fare price is cheaper. If I were to be a driver I would chose to drive in a Rural Community, my recommendations:)
